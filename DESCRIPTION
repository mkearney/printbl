Description: A limitation of 'tibble' printing is that variables are hidden if
    they do not fit within the device's width. This package solves this problem 
    via printing rows. In other words, this package allows users to preview ALL 
    of a data frame without sacrificing pretty printing behaviors of tibbles.
